# Machine learning methods that fight crime
In machine learning, a computer learns by experience to perform increasingly complex data analysis. Dimension reduction is a type of machine learning that lowers the amount of data to consider in high-dimensional datasets like computer network traffic or police photo libraries. High-dimensional data is hard to analyze because it has so many different features (dimensions or attributes) per sample. Another example is blood data, which contains a vast amount of information about disease, chemical substance use, genetics, and more in each sample. 

Dimension reduction decomposes (breaks down or flattens) large high-dimensional datasets into understandable parts. Some common methods of dimension reduction are principal component analysis (PCA), feature selection, and non-negative matrix factorization. This article describes each of these machine learning techniques and how they can fight cybercrime and identify criminals.
## Principal component analysis
The [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html#sklearn.decomposition.PCA) method identifies patterns and variations in large datasets and groups them into smaller datasets of related variables, or principal components. PCA decomposes data with the least variance and preserves data that varies the most. This machine learning technique identifies important information in large, seemingly unrelated datasets. With PCA, you can find and study relevant deviations in your data. 

PCA can [detect network cyberattacks](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~vemuri/papers/pcaVisualization.pdf). In the complex flow of network traffic data, it’s usually hard to find a small variance that indicates an intrusion. By creating sets of data with the most variance, PCA flags abnormal behavior in large traffic datasets. By repeating that experience, a detection system learns to flag behavior made by intrusion and system abuse attacks. 
## Feature selection
The [feature selection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#feature-selection) method removes features that either have the same value in all data or don’t vary to a set degree. Feature selection is often used to preprocess data before applying other machine learning techniques like PCA. It can calculate the importance of a dataset’s features based on certain specifications. 

An example of feature reduction is a [facial recognition system](http://www.ijeei.org/docs-12314254465331454f38018.pdf) that finds a particular person in a photo database. PCA is often used for facial recognition, but it’s an imperfect method that sometimes makes wrong matches. PCA samples are whole faces, but those datasets are extremely high-dimensional because each face sample has a massive number of attributes. And the PCA machine learning method doesn’t adjust as well as a human viewer to variations caused by aging, expression changes, and lighting. 

Genetic algorithm (GA) is a feature selection technique that’s often combined with PCA for more accurate facial recognition. GA can find the most relevant set of features in a database of images based on gene samples. This technique reduces the dimensions of large facial datasets, which results in a lower recognition error rate by PCA. 
## Non-negative matrix factorization 
Non-negative matric factorization ([NMF or NNMF](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#nmf)) is a dimension reduction alternative that measures and compares distances between visual features. NMF doesn’t subtract the least varying dimensions from a dataset. Instead, it finds and combines the closest matching lines to create a vector image composed of the most relevant features. This machine learning technique can produce clear visual representations from large high-dimension datasets like the photo libraries.

An example of how NMF can fight crime is by creating a [facial composite](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~changbo/publications/IJPRAI05.pdf), a type of facial recognition. Law enforcement and other agencies use facial composite software to produce a combined representative picture from multiple photos from crime scenes, police databases, and other sources. These photographs might show the same person at different ages, angles, and lighting. NMF is faster and more accurate than PCA for creating facial composites because it draws lines based on a small set of the closest matched data instead of an entire high-dimensional face dataset.
